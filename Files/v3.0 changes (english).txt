PROBLEMS DETECTED:
-Can't save. If you reload, your lives are resetted to 4, and all credits to 3, making game impossible to lose.
-With some characters Mr.Karate, Mr.Big, Superyuri... the game is very easy.
-Characters are constantly winning lives due to some bugs and a low lifescore value. Some characters have a 15 lives limit, others not. Brothel beds give you a life each, eliminating all interest in the other bonus stages.
-Many combos, especially forward, back, forward combos, are very hard to detect
-Chargerate is very high in all the characters, turning the game basically into magic spamming.
-Characters have a lot of hiding movements, some can be executed, others not
-Grabs are very hard, with some characters are almost impossible to escape without destroying the gamepad, and it's very buggy especially playing with Mature-Vice or two and three players
-There is a very high difficulty curve when entering Antarctica due to the lack of an intermediate bonus stage. However, it is not a problem because you can continue infinitely...
-I wish I could use the training dummy to see how much damage I do with my combos
-Some combos do a massive damage that kills most enemies and bosses in a single attack, such as power punch/kick of Mature and Vice, and some combos of Mr.K and Mr Big.
-If you enter on Yuri, Mrk, Robert vs Ryo and Deterrent stages with a second and/or third player, all but the firts dead and lose all lives and one credit. If they try to enter again, they lose another credit. You cannot enter as any other character than the default one even on free mode
-The combo counter is useless
-There are many unbalanced, excessively powerful and excessively weak movements
-The amount of life change and causes strange problems at spawn and respawn with some characters as Mr K, Mr Big, all vehicles, etc. or in certain maps such as the free map, Yuri, Mr K, and Tank stages


		******************************************
		*		v2.0	CHANGES	              	 *
		******************************************

- Compatible with newer Openbor versions (not 100% tested, I recommend using the original executable).
- Now you can save stage, score, credits, lifes, character, max combo and club cards. See readme.txt (bug nº 4 of BUGS-AND-ISSUES) if you get a black screen loading any stage.
- Complete rework of movements in damage, power, MP consumption, speed, flight, invulnerability, boxes, etc on all characters so that all movements have their usefulness at the appropriate time and do not abuse one over another, and no character is excessively powerful with respect to others
- Increased difficulty. With two players it's much more harder (+400 enemies).
- A lot of obstacles, enemies, and bosses now have more lifepoints, and other adjustments to statistics. Overlord vs Mr.K battle is an exception, now Overlord transformed has less lifepoints and less attack.
- Improved score system: Every 250.000 points: +1up. At every stage completed: 30.000*(Nº stage) + 15.000*(Nº remaining lives) + 1000*(Max Combo). If you warp to a stage with a rune, the stage counter starts from 1
- Max combo rush is saved between stages, an resetted to zero after the Score Screen.
- Complete reworking of life and points items to adjust according to the new difficulty, in addition to a new +100MP blue item.
- A more complete moveset menu for all characters, included vehicles (sorry for the botch graphic job)
- A new moveset menu for the two falling stages, and a new character (Syurifall)
- A new Bonus Map before Antarctica
- Escape from grabs are slighty easier. Circle the joystick and push attack, jump and special.
- All slams and special grabs of players and enemies provide invulnerability, for reasons of game mechanics, and to solve most bugs with grab scripts
- Reduced MP chargerate on all characters.
- Reduced lifepoints of some characters to match them to the rest. Slightly increased lifepoints of main characters.
- Adjusted time of bonus stages
- Fixed a lot of bugs on characters and scripts
- Fixed HP bug on all characters and maps
- Fixed bugs and small aesthetic changes on some stages
- Fixed some graphics errors
- Some traps are less deadly, others more
- Life of the training dummy now is visible (with an icon) to observe the damage inflicted
- All characters can join story mode when game is completed for first time.
- Yuri, Mr K, and Robert vs Ryo stages can be played by 2 or more players. On free mode you can select any character on this stages.
- No more credit losing when another player enters on Yuri, Mr.K, Turture, and Tank stages.
- Fixed character change system at these stages:
 *On Yuri, Robert and Ryo stages, all players change to this character.
 *On Mr. K stage, only the first player changes, the rest remain the same.
 *On the Tank and Torture stages, only one player can participate, the rest remain invisible and static, but reappear in the next stage.
- You can unlock all extra characters finishing game one time, except tank who need two times.
- Due to an error that I could not solve, to make this compatible with more modern versions of Openbor, now the cup game of club Kat only gives up to four Hu Lala cards instead of apple, moneybag, 1up and one card. Keep in mind that you must get on the bar to be able to take them, even if they appear in front of the bar.
- Fixed new bugs on newer versions of Openbor (Game intro, cup game on club kat, some vehicles and tank caused errors or crashes, turture stage, johnny stages, etc)
- Complete reworking of all characters, vehicles, and a lot of enemies impact and attack boxes thanks to the debug mode of newer Openbor version.
- A loooot of more changes -see "Cambios (español).txt" and "leeme (español).txt", only on spanish, sorry.


		******************************************
		*		v2.1	CHANGES	              	 *
		******************************************
		
- Error in wich all players lost a life 99 seconds after the intro, fixed
- Minor adjustments on Super Yuri (damage and impact boxes), Kasumi (jump+attack/jump+down+attack inverted), Eve (jump+a and jump+da change behavior, damage,impact boxes and MP consumption), King (damage, impact and attack boxes), Mature and Vice (new jumpland animation and higher jump to Vice, and impact boxes for both), MrBig (new jumpland animation, impact and attack boxes, damage, MP consumption and fixed infinite air combo dfj+j+j... to dfj+j+j), Pipas (better animations on dodge, riseattack, runattack and runslide, impact boxes and MP consumption), Jack (damage, impact boxes and MP consumption), Remuinho (impact boxes, some statistics), Johnny (property of ground attack -now only damage enemies on the ground-, slower idle animation, change death animation, and MP consumption on machinegun version, impact and attack boxes on all Johnnys), Mr K. (runjumpattack can't be cancelled before hit anything), on the 3 mounted vehicles (impact boxes) and on all 7 characters of the falling stages (damage and impact boxes).
- Mr Big hadoken and Remuinho tornado now completes vanish animation, on 1.6 these dissapear suddenly. 
- Now you don't need to restart ALL the last stages if you dead on Ryo vs Overlord stages, only the last one.
- Some big bugs that only happens with newer versions of Openbor but not with the original AOF.exe provided.
- Minor changes on aesthetic, items, and health of enemies for some levels.
- Impact and attack boxes of a lot of enemies and bosses fixed
- Remuinho on 1.6 gives 450.000 points on the fall stage and 25.000 on 2.0 I discover the cause: lifepoints of Remuinho. Now when timer goes to 0 gives you 375.000 points.	
- Now wolves, bulls and bears can't be hit on the ground infinite times, only one.
- Restored grab buttons animation. It dissapears at few seconds, as in 2.0.
- Some stages now can scroll faster.
- Maximum of 15 lives now works with all characters and players.
- Added secret moves to bad ending.
- Counterattacks of Mr K, Johnny, Mr Big and Remuinho are now performed only with attack button, not with block button. This make easy to continue blocking instead of counterattack.
Note: Keep in mind that one of the changes in 2.0 is now these characters don't counterattack any attack, only against strong attacks (-15HP or higher). On 1.6 the backward motion during block (blockpain animation) was activated with any enemy attack, making it impossible to block with these characters.

Bugs from 2.0 fixed:
- Minor errors caused by me for leaving development code undeleted, fixed
- Now Openbor executable is in english by default, not spanish
- Mr Big hadoken bounces offscreen fixed (error caused by me)

- Original 1.7.2 changes incorporated (Mr K fixes, palettes, better grab movements...).
- HP and MP bar color changed (transparency of the MP bar cannot be changed, unfortunately).
- On might test now you can't mash buttons before the counter starts (10,9,8...)
- In the stage where you drive a tank, now the combo and score earned is given to all three players equally, if they are present, and not just to the player driving the tank.
- Spanish translation of Openbor menu completed.
- Buttons in the button configuration menu now have more specific names.
- And much, much, more...

BUGS FIXED:
- All ending bugs fixed, including bugs that existed since the original version. Now you can pause on the falling scenario, Ryo can retry the kamehameha if he is electrocuted while trying (previously he lost MP and couldn't retry), an image of the joystick to release yourself from the Overlord appears correctly, scenes of the uppercut do not have the superimposed characters, scene of Ryo spitting out the tooth highlights the tank's cannon as a clue to where to nail the Overlord, etc.
- On Kat Club striptease, now you can't select more of one chick.
- Added skipselect / select at the beginning of the free map to prevent invisible characters from appearing when selecting.
- Now the damage done with the 'hurt' command gives points to the player (when you repeatedly hit a grabbed enemy).
- Fixed bug that prevented some players from selecting the stage in free mode if two or more players are present.
- Fixed Fastryo selection screen for 2nd and 3rd player, incorrectly pointing to Ryo version.
- Added fall7 to some enemies so now when grabbed they aren't in strange positions.
- Fixed some fall animations without impact box on many enemies, like Crazy Joe.
- Moving platforms on some stages will now no longer leave the player stuck forever.
- A huge number of bugfixes impossible to list (it is the largest number of fixes since the first game release).

KNOWN BUGS UNFIXED:
- Animations on Ryo vs Overlord grabs reproduce behind the characters, not on front.
