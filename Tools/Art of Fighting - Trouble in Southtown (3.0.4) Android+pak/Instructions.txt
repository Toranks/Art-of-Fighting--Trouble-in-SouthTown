INSTRUCTIONS:

Install the apk file to install Openbor in its latest stable version for Android if you haven't it installed.

Move the AOF.pak file to the OpenBOR/Paks folder on the root of your internal or external memory (both are valid).

Launch Openbor and choose AOF.pak (if you have multiple games installed) to start playing. If you only have AOF installed, it will start automatically.
