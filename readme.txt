---------------------//--CONTROLS-OPTIONS--//----------------------------------

		when you find password tablets.
	( its best to take a screenshot than write 
	     the whole dam thing on a piece of paper 
	  image should be located in the screenshots folder)

NOTE:	i havent tested the game on xbox360/psp or android
	i can teste it on xbox360 and psp if people ask me
		but android its out of my reach


-----------------------//--BUGS-AND-ISSUES--//------------------------------

	- Here are some bugs that iam currently aware

	1- In the test your might level you may find to dificult if not impossible
	   to raise the focus bar. The problem seems to have something to do with
	   the CPU/GPU speed if your playing in a 4core 3.0/i5/i7 cpu it may be to dificult
	   to raise the focus bar.

	2- The grab escape could malfunction in 2/3 player mode for example if an
	   enemy grabs player 1 and slams him against player 2, player 2 will be the one
	   doing the escape animation.

	3- the cup game in club kat can fail sometimes in the last very fast i think it 
	   also has something to do with CPU speed.

	*note:	i was unable to fix this errors, but they only happen very rarely
		ive tested the game and it worked 100% until the end.

	- If the game is shuttering (bbbbrrrrr..Hiiickkk) or slowing down.
	  delete all files in the Saves folder (AOF.cfg AOF.sav etc)
	  its probably reading the config that was used on another computer.
