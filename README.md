# Art of Fighting: Trouble in SouthTown
 Art of Fighting: Trouble in SouthTown. An Openbor game.

Created in 2017 by Jon Silva, it was already considered one of the best games, if not the best, created with the Openbor engine, a veteran free software engine to create Beat'em up games, inspired on Streets of Rage.

On mid-2019 I began to modify it for personal use and with my friends, but I realized the potential it had to be improved and refined, and I asked the author for permission to make a major public update. He was delighted, and since then I have made an immense amount of changes and improvements that allow the game to function spectacularly not only visually, but also with mechanics, avoiding any kind of weird effects and rewarding the practice of a veteran player.
At the same time, the characters control has been greatly simplified to facilitate that any newbie can start with this game.
On the other hand, as there were many people asking the original author, I have updated the game to be functional in modern versions of the engine, which facilitates its compatibility with different devices such as Android, videoconsoles, televisions, raspberry ..., etc.
I have also fixed numerous bugs from the previous version, many of which significantly worsened the gaming experience, and new ones that have emerged in modern versions of Openbor.
The list of changes is huge and there are many significant things not to mention, you can check both in spanish and english in the Files folder in two text files, more complete in spanish than in english.

You can also see my progress during the game update and samples of various types of stages on my YouTube channel:

With this game is wich we can see all the resources allowed by this engine raised to maximum power, taking spectacularity and mechanics to the highest level. Several of its unique features (difficult to see in games of this type, both of this engine and any other commercial game of this gender) are:
- 36 different characters for the main stages of fighting on foot. 7 for the special stages. 11 different vehicles for the horizontal road stages. 5 vehicles for the Out Run type stages.
- Great variety on the stages and missions to be carried out, with lots of mini-games, secrets, and hidden details that make it very replayable.
- Crowd of kinematics and animations.
- Great soundtrack.
- More than 20 hours of story mode.
- QTE (quick time events) in certain mini-games, and when some enemies grab you, being able to get rid of them by pressing certain buttons.
- Map to visit the city, all stages, exclusive fights against an harder version of all bosses, all scenes, images of the game, enemies, and making-of.
